# Day 20 of 30:
### Today, I worked on integrating ScaffoldMessenger, refining the Cart model, using the List.fold method, and implementing the "Add to Cart" functionality in my Flutter application. ScaffoldMessenger allowed me to display Snackbars for providing user feedback efficiently. Enhancing the Cart model ensured robust data management for items added to the cart. Utilizing List.fold helped me efficiently compute totals and manage list transformations. Implementing the "Add to Cart" functionality was crucial for creating a seamless shopping experience, allowing users to select items and add them to their cart with ease.

Stay tuned for more updates on my journey! ðŸš€ðŸ“±
